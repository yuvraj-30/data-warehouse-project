# Portfolio Story (How to Present This Project)

## One-liner
Built an end-to-end analytics workflow integrating CRM and ERP data into a conformed warehouse (Bronze→Silver→Gold) and delivered business-ready customer/product reporting marts.

## The business problem
Operational systems often disagree on customer/product identifiers, which breaks reporting. This project focuses on **mapping and master data conformance** so commercial reporting is accurate.

## What I delivered
- A layered warehouse with clear data quality boundaries.
- Conformed Customer Master and Product Master.
- A sales fact table suitable for Power BI/Tableau.
- Analytics scripts to answer ranking, trend, segmentation, part-to-whole, and performance questions.
- Ready-to-consume reporting tables in `/reports`.

## Why it is relevant to wholesale/ERP teams
- Mirrors master data maintenance work.
- Demonstrates customer/product mapping across systems.
- Shows governance mindset (quality checks + documented grains).
